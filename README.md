# 🖥️ Ping Dashboard

## 📌 Description
Ping Dashboard is a lightweight Python-based tool to **monitor the availability of multiple IP addresses in real-time**.  
It uses a **Tkinter GUI** to display IP addresses, hostname, rack information, and live ping statistics.
  
Color-coded rows help quickly identify:
- 🟢 Alive (reachable)
- 🟡 Partial (recent ping failed but not yet fully down)
- 🔴 Down (3 consecutive ping failures)
- 🔵 Unmounted (manually marked using double cliking unmounted cell or using spacebar)
